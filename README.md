Pneumonia is a disease which occurs in the lungs caused by a bacterial infection. Early diagnosis is an important factor in terms of the successful treatment process. Generally, the disease can be diagnosed from chest X-ray images by an expert radiologist. The diagnoses can be subjective for some reasons such as the appearance of disease which can be unclear in chest X-ray images or can be confused with other diseases. Therefore, computer-aided diagnosis systems are needed to guide the clinicians. In this work, Deep learning algorithms are developed namely convolutional neural networks algorithm for the dataset to perform image classification. The dataset has chest X-ray images, and the developed model will be evaluated based on some statistical parameters. The goal of this algorithm is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable whether the person suffers from pneumonia or not.
